In order to estimate M for the wordpress problem we solve a surrogate optimization problem which takes into account only constraints involving number of instances (i.e. Require-Provide and Deployment with bounded number of instances) and minimizes the total number of instances. As M is set to the sum of the number of instances estimated by solving the surrogate problem, it means that it corresponds to the case when each instance will be assigned to a distinct
machine which would correspond to the case when all components would be in conflict. Since in real world cases usually not all components are in conflict, it follows that M is an upper bound estimate of the number of virtual machines required to satisfy all application-specific constraints.
